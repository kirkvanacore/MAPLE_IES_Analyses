    Fidelity Metrics Analysis</a></h4>
<p> This markdown contains analyses of the cross-program/condition fidelity metrics listed below. The analyses include visualizations and statistical tests of the fidelity by program/condition as well as analyses of how these metrics vary by nesting units (school, teacher, class)<br>
  <b>Key Variables:</b>
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Number of Assignments Started (fidelity_started_sum)</li>
  <li>Number of Assignments Complete (fidelity_complete_sum)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Takeways:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students in the Dragon Box condition had signficantly lower assignments started and complete. </li>
  <li>Both metrics had bimodal distributions, suggesting two distnict populations: high and low fedility </li>
  <li>Much of the vairance in fedility was assocaited with students nexting units (school and class). Intra-class correlations for both school/class ranged from .29 to .36 </li>
</ul>
